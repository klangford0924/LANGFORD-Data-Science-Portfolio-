## 🏀 WNBA Draft Picks Analysis

### 🚀 Project Overview
This interactive data application was developed for my *Introduction to Data Science* course. It explores WNBA draft picks from 1997 to 2022 using a clean, user-friendly Streamlit interface.  
Users can filter by team, draft year, and pick number to dynamically explore trends and player data.

### 🛠️ Instructions to Run the App Locally

1. **Install Streamlit** (if not already installed):  
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   ```
2. Download the dataset wnba.csv and ensure it is saved in the same directory as your main app file (e.g., app.py or main.py).

3. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal:
```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```
4. Run the app with Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

5. A new browser tab will open displaying the app. If it doesn't open automatically, copy and paste the provided localhost link into your browser.

### ⚙️ Features
- **Interactive Filtering**: Narrow results by team, year, or draft pick number to explore targeted subsets of the data.  
- **Data Preview**: View the filtered dataset in an easy-to-read table.

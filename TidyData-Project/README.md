## 🧪 Federal R&D Spending Analysis

### 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed for my Introduction to Data Science course to explore long-term trends in U.S. federal research and development (R&D) spending.  
**Goals:**
- Analyze R&D spending across various government departments from 1976 to the present.
- Clean and reshape the dataset using Tidy Data principles.
- Visualize trends and insights using effective plots and tables.

The project demonstrates data wrangling skills, familiarity with Tidy Data concepts, and the ability to present data-driven insights clearly.

### 🧩 App Features
Tidy Data Principles Applied:
- Each variable is in its own column.
- Each observation is in its own row.
- Each type of observational unit is in its own table.

Data Cleaning & Transformation:
- Unpivoted wide-form year columns into long-form format.
- Standardized department names.
- Adjusted for GDP-based comparisons.

Visualizations:
- Line plots comparing spending over time by department.
- Bar charts showing top departments by R&D spending.
- Heatmaps for cross-departmental comparison.

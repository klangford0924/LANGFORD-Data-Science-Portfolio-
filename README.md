## ðŸ“‚ **Projects**  

###  [Federal R&D Spending Analysis](https://github.com/klangford0924/LANGFORD-Data-Science-Portfolio-/tree/main/TidyData-Project) 
- Analyzed federal R&D spending across U.S. government departments from 1976 to the present.  
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset using Tidy Data principles.  
- Created multiple visualizations and pivot tables to explore spending trends.  
- Demonstrates my ability to handle real-world data, apply data cleaning techniques, and create insightful visualizations.  

### **[WNBA Draft Picks Analysis](https://github.com/klangford0924/LANGFORD-Data-Science-Portfolio-/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app)**  
- Built a Streamlit app to look at WNBA draft data over the last five years.  
- Enabled users to filter data by team, year, and draft pick.  
- Demonstrates my ability to create interactive data apps and work with structured sports data.  

### **[Interactive Machine Learning Explorer](https://langford-datascience-machinelearningproject.streamlit.app/)**  
- Developed a Streamlit web app that allows users to experiment with different machine learning models using both real and custom datasets.  
- Features include the ability to upload CSV datasets, select machine learning models (KNN, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression), tune hyperparameters, and view evaluation metrics.    
- Demonstrates my ability to build interactive applications for data science, implement machine learning models, and present results in a user-friendly format.

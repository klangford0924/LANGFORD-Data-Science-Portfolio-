# LANGFORD-Data-Science-Portfolio-

## ðŸ“š About This Repository
Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**, a curated collection of projects in Intro to Data Science that demonstrate my skills in **data analysis** . Each project is designed to solve real-world problems or provide insights into meaningful datasets.

---

## ðŸ’¡ **About This Portfolio**  
Each project reflects my growing skills in data analysis, visualization, and cleaning, specifically in projects compelted for my Introduction to Data Science Class at the University of Notre Dame.

## ðŸ“‚ **At A Glance**  

###  [Federal R&D Spending Analysis (TidyData-Project)](https://github.com/klangford0924/LANGFORD-Data-Science-Portfolio-/tree/main/TidyData-Project) 
Goal: Understand trends in U.S. government research and development spending from 1976 to the present.
- Cleaned and reshaped the dataset using Tidy Data principles.
- Created multi-dimensional visualizations and pivot tables to highlight funding patterns.
- Skills: Data wrangling, visualization (seaborn, matplotlib).

### **[WNBA Draft Picks Analysis (basic_streamlit_app)](https://github.com/klangford0924/LANGFORD-Data-Science-Portfolio-/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app)**  
Goal: Explore recent WNBA draft trends in an interactive format.
- Built a Streamlit app enabling filtering by team, draft year, and player stats.
- Integrated user interaction for dynamic exploration of player data.
- Skills: Streamlit app development, UI logic, data cleaning

### **[Interactive Machine Learning Explorer (MLStreamlitApp)](https://langford-datascience-machinelearningproject.streamlit.app/)**
